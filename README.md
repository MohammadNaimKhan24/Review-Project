# Review-Project
This is a simple Vanilla JavaScript Project.Here we are calling a method when the DOMContent is being loaded.In this method we are accessing our local data for review which is stored in an array.Also we are selecting our buttons, paragraph, heading etc to apply our logic or functionality.
